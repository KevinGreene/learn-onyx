;; The final feature of flow conditions that we'll cover are
;; key exclusions. Sometimes, you'll want to convey some information
;; from a function to a flow condition predicate that doesn't
;; need to be sent downstream. In the example below, we're going
;; to route users based on their age. Their age is only relevant
;; to the routing, and isn't required after that.
;;
;; Use :flow/exclude-keys and set its value to a vector of keywords
;; to remove from each segment if present.
;;
;; Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test lambdajam.jobs.test-5-4`
